# Technical Debt and Findings Register

The master list of findings. Detailed write-ups: SEC-* in [security-and-privacy.md](security-and-privacy.md), FIN-* in [financial-integrity-risks.md](financial-integrity-risks.md). DEF-* (defects) and MNT-* (maintainability) are described here.

Status: **Verified** (confirmed in code or by execution) · **Suspected** (plausible, not exercised) · **Unverified** (depends on things that cannot be seen).
Priority: **P0** fix before any real data or exposed deployment · **P1** next · **P2** planned · **P3** opportunistic.

## A. Security and financial-integrity items (immediate concern)

| ID | Sev. | Status | Summary | Location | Module | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 | Critical | Verified | DEMO_MODE is on unless disabled and bypasses auth (any OTP, unverified JWTs, staff tokens) | `server.js:25,101-138,461,609` | Auth | P0 |
| SEC-02 | Critical | Verified | PDF route persists the client body before authorization | `server.js:1111-1129` | PDF | P0 |

| SEC-06 | High | Verified | Plaintext passwords and PII in localStorage | `storage.ts:519-590` | Client data | P0 |
| SEC-03 | High | Verified | Any staff role can set any status. Client-supplied history | `server.js:975-977` | Back office | P1 |

| FIN-02 | Medium | Verified/Suspected | Request numbers generated on the client. The server may replace them, but Step 10 keeps the local number (when `/active` fails, or on a clash) | `storage.ts`, `server.js:1026-1032`, `App.tsx:262` | Wizard | P1 |

## B. Defects

| ID | Sev. | Status | Description | Evidence | Impact | Action | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEF-01 | High | Verified (source + built bundle) | `useEffect` used but not imported in `Step7Guarantor.tsx` (`:85`) and `Step8DocumentUpload.tsx` (`:50, :56`) | `tsc --noEmit` errors. Imports at line 1 of each file. The production bundle contains exactly 3 unbound `useEffect(` references, i.e. it was not renamed as an import would be | `ReferenceError` when Steps 7 and 8 render, which blocks the wizard (not yet observed in a browser) | Add the import. Add `tsc` to CI | P0 |
| DEF-02 | Low | Verified | `GuarantorItem` not imported in `App.tsx:216` | tsc | Type-only (no runtime effect) | Import it | P1 |
| DEF-03 | Medium | Verified | PDF signature method mismatch (`'draw'/'type'` vs `'drawn_touch'/'typed_name'`). The image is in `signatureDataUri` | `pdfService.js:146-166`, `Step9ReviewConfirm.tsx:139-141` | Every PDF shows "Typed Signature / Signed by —". Drawn signatures never render | Map the methods correctly | P1 |
| DEF-04 | Medium | Suspected | Back-office status change throws for applications not in local storage | `BackOffice.tsx:132-146`, `storage.ts:1114-1115` | Staff cannot change status from a fresh browser | Operate on server data | P1 |
| DEF-05 | Low | Verified | `uploadFile(file, missingDocType)` passes the document type as `scope` | `Step11StatusTimeline.tsx:115` | Harmless today (falls through to borrower scope), misleading | Remove the argument | P3 |
| DEF-06 | Low | Verified (executed) | Test date time-bomb: fixture visa `2027-10-08` | `test_guarantors_and_scoring.js:582,624,667` | 3 tests fail since about 2026-10 | Use relative dates | P1 |
| DEF-07 | Low | Verified | Funding hand-off and all actions ignore the current status (e.g. Forward a `Received` or `Rejected` application) | `BackOffice.tsx:1028-1080` | Invalid state changes | Server transition table (SEC-03) | P1 |
| DEF-08 | Low | Verified | `LoanPurpose` casing mismatch (`'Cash flow'` type vs `'Cash Flow'` option) | `types.ts:22`, `appConfig.ts:42` | Analytics split by spelling | Normalise | P3 |
| DEF-09 | Low | Verified | `users.isActive` never checked | `server.js` (no reads) | Cannot disable accounts | Check at login and in `authenticate` | P2 |
| DEF-10 | Low | Inferred | PDF uses Helvetica only, so non-Latin text will not render | `pdfService.js` | Hebrew, Thai and Chinese names garbled | Register a Unicode font | P2 |
| DEF-11 | Low | Verified | Server SMS always English although `language` is stored | `server.js:346-371` | Borrowers may not understand the messages | Localise the templates | P2 |

## C. Maintainability

| ID | Sev. | Status | Description | Evidence | Action | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MNT-01 | Medium | Verified | Dual data layer (`storageService` shadow backend) duplicates auth, application lifecycle, document reuse, notifications | `storage.ts` (1340 lines) | Reduce it to a draft cache, with the server as the single source of truth | P1 |
| MNT-02 | Medium | Verified | `server.js` is a 1309-line monolith | — | Split into routes, middleware, repositories and services | P2 |
| MNT-03 | Medium | Verified | Hand-mirrored eligibility engine (JS and TS) | both `eligibilityScoring.*` | Shared golden-test fixture, or a shared package, or server-only scoring with an API | P2 |
| MNT-04 | Medium | Verified | No migration tool. Additive ALTERs only | `database.js` | Adopt a migration runner with a version table | P2 |
| MNT-05 | Medium | Verified | No CI, linting or test framework | repo | See [improvement-roadmap.md](improvement-roadmap.md) | P1 |
| MNT-06 | Low | Verified | Documentation drift: README is the AI Studio template; `implementation-plan.md` claims tsc passes; CLAUDE.md lists 4 languages (5 exist); names differ (QuickLoan / LendGlobal / "react-example") | — | Update the docs and names | P2 |
| MNT-07 | Low | Verified | Unused dependencies: `@google/genai`, `express` (frontend). `.env.example` lists unused `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`APP_URL`, but not `VITE_API_URL` | `frontend/package.json` | Remove them. Fix `.env.example` | P3 |
| MNT-08 | Low | Verified | Stale `bun.lock` alongside `package-lock.json` | `frontend/` | Delete `bun.lock` | P3 |
| MNT-09 | Low | Verified | Hard-coded English strings in components | `Step2Auth.tsx:155`, `Step7Guarantor.tsx:288-294`, `Step8DocumentUpload.tsx:93-104` | Move them to `translations.ts` | P2 |
| MNT-10 | Low | Verified | Large components (`Step2Auth` 1608 lines, `BackOffice` 1099) | — | Extract subcomponents and hooks | P3 |
| MNT-11 | Low | Verified | Single JS bundle > 500 kB, including staff UI and seed data | vite build output | Code-split the back office. Strip seeds from production builds | P3 |
| MNT-12 | Low | Verified | No indexes on frequently queried columns | `database.js` | Add indexes (`userId`, `isSubmitted`, `requestNumber` UNIQUE) | P2 |
| MNT-14 | Low | Verified (script parse) | 28 translation keys present in `en` are missing from each of `he`, `th`, `zh` and `tl` (silent English fallback), e.g. `pleaseSpecify`, `docPassportTitle` | `i18n/translations.ts` | Add the keys. Add a completeness check | P2 |
| MNT-15 | Low | Verified | `minBorrowerAge` and `minVisaValidityMonths` in config are ignored by the UI (literals `21` and `6`) | `Step3BorrowerDetails.tsx:99-101`, `Step4ResidencyDetails.tsx:62,73` | Read from config (and from the server once FIN-04 is done) | P2 |
| MNT-13 | Low | Verified | Guarantor single/array sync logic repeated 3 times | `server.js:186-210, 232-254`, `storage.ts` | Drop the legacy `guarantor` after migrating the data | P3 |
