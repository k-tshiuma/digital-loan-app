# QuickLoan (LendGlobal): Technical Documentation

Reverse-engineered documentation of the existing codebase, produced on **2026-10-11** from branch `feature/guarantor-enhancements-and-scoring` (HEAD `397b7d9`). The source code is the source of truth. Where this documentation and the code disagree, the code wins, and please update this documentation.

## At a glance

- **What it is:** a mobile-first **web** application (React 19 SPA + Express 5 API + SQLite) where foreign workers in Israel apply for micro-loans (₪500–10,000, 3–12 months) and track their status. Staff review applications in a back office.
- **What it is not:** a native mobile app (no Flutter or React Native), or a money-movement system. There are no disbursements, repayments, balances or ledger, and the funding-partner hand-off is simulated.
- **Maturity:** prototype or demo grade. **It should not process real borrower data** until the Critical and High findings are fixed. The most urgent are SEC-01 (demo mode bypasses authentication unless explicitly disabled), SEC-02 (the PDF endpoint writes unvalidated records), FIN-01 (submission success is shown without server confirmation), FIN-17 (the payout bank account stays editable after approval) and DEF-01 (Steps 7 and 8 likely crash because of a missing import).

## Verification status legend

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Verified** | Confirmed by reading source, by search, or by executing a command |
| **Inferred** | A strong conclusion from code, not directly observed (e.g. runtime behaviour that was not executed) |
| **Suspected** | A plausible defect or risk that needs validation |
| **Unverified** | Depends on environment, configuration or data that could not be seen |
| **Not Implemented** | Confirmed absent from the codebase |
| **Not Accessible** | The resource exists outside the repo, or could not be reached |

## Scope and limitations
- Backend: inspected in full. Frontend: services, `App.tsx`, config, and the security- and workflow-relevant parts of the components inspected in detail; presentational UI code was skimmed. See [project-inventory.md §8](project-inventory.md#8-initial-coverage-and-limitations).
- No deployed environment, CI, secrets or third-party accounts were available.
- `npm audit` was not run. Dependency vulnerability status is unknown.
- **This is not a penetration test or a compliance assessment.** No claim of security, compliance or production readiness is made.

## Brief-to-file mapping
The documentation brief assumed a Flutter or React Native mobile app. Its structure was adapted as follows: mobile-specific topics (signing, store releases, Keychain/Keystore, deep links, biometrics, push) are covered in [mobile-application.md](mobile-application.md) and [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md), and marked *Not Applicable* or *Not Implemented* where relevant. `database-relationships.md` was folded into [database.md §5](database.md#5-entity-relationship-diagram).
