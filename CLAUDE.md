# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

QuickLoan: a digital micro-loan application for foreign workers in Israel. Two independent npm projects (no root `package.json`):

- `backend/` — Express 5 + SQLite (CommonJS), single-file API in `server.js`
- `frontend/` — React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 (TypeScript, ESM)

The root `README.md` is the stock AI Studio template and is outdated. `implementation-plan.md` documents the phased feature work (security, file uploads, analytics, SSE, etc.) and is the best record of intent. `design/DESIGN.md` holds the design tokens (colors, typography) that the UI follows.

## Commands

Backend (from `backend/`, port 5000 by default):
- `npm run dev`: nodemon server
- `npm start`: plain node
- Tests are standalone scripts, not a framework. Each one `require('./server')`, listens on its own port (5002/5003/5004), runs assertions over HTTP, and exits non-zero on failure. Run one with:
  - `node test_verification.js`
  - `node test_guarantors_and_scoring.js`
  - `node test_returning_user_prefill.js`
  - `npm test` is a placeholder and does nothing.
- Tests use the real `database.sqlite`. There is no separate test DB.

Frontend (from `frontend/`, port 3000):
- `npm run dev`: Vite dev server
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`: type-check only (`tsc --noEmit`). There is no ESLint.

## Backend architecture

- `server.js` holds all routes, middleware, OTP/SSE state and helpers. It exports `app` and only calls `listen` when it runs as the main module, which is how the tests import it.
- `database.js` creates the schema on startup. Schema changes are made by appending `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` statements to the list there; errors are ignored when a column already exists. There is no migrations tool. JSON-shaped fields (guarantors, riskFlags, eligibilityBreakdown, profileData, …) are stored as TEXT and parsed or serialized in `server.js`.
- Auth: `optionalAuth` runs globally. Then `app.use('/api', authenticate)` protects every route registered after it, so public auth routes (`/api/users/login`, `request-otp`, `verify-otp`, …) must be declared *before* that line. Staff endpoints use `requireStaff(...roles)`. Roles: `customer_service`, `credit_reviewer`, `system_admin`, `funding_entity` (plus `borrower`).
- **DEMO_MODE** is on unless `NODE_ENV=production` or `DEMO_MODE=false`. It enables a fixed OTP `123456`, `/api/auth/staff-token` role-picker tokens, mock Google login, codes echoed back in responses, and a fallback `demo_user` identity when no or invalid token is sent. Keep this in mind when reasoning about access control. `JWT_SECRET` falls back to a dev constant outside production.
- Two scoring systems, which are different things:
  - `creditEngine.js`: the rule-based risk pre-screen (riskScore/riskLevel/riskFlags). Thresholds can be overridden through `PUT /api/config/credit-rules`, which persists them in the `app_config` table. It is advisory only and never blocks a submission.
  - `services/eligibilityScoring.js`: the indicative eligibility score. **It is mirrored in `frontend/src/services/eligibilityScoring.ts`.** Keep both in sync when you change factors or weights.
- Uploads: multer writes to `backend/uploads/` (gitignored), metadata goes in the `uploaded_files` table, and files are served via `GET /api/uploads/:filename`.
- Real-time: `GET /api/applications/:id/events` is SSE. Status changes in `PUT /api/applications/:id` broadcast to subscribers, and `Step11StatusTimeline` listens with `EventSource`.
- `services/smsService.js` (Twilio) and `services/emailService.js` (SMTP) log mock output to the console when their env vars (`TWILIO_SID`/`TWILIO_TOKEN`, `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS`) are unset. `pdfService.js` streams an application summary PDF with pdfkit.

## Frontend architecture

- `App.tsx` drives a numbered wizard with a `currentStep` state (1 Language → 2 Auth → 3–9 form steps → 10 Submission success → 11 Status timeline). Each step is a `components/StepN*.tsx`. `BackOffice.tsx` (staff console, including `AnalyticsDashboard`) replaces the wizard when it is toggled on.
- Two data layers:
  - `services/api.ts`: the backend client. Base URL is `VITE_API_URL` or `http://localhost:5000/api`. It stores separate borrower and staff JWTs in localStorage and exports `ApiError` and `isNetworkError`.
  - `services/storage.ts`: a large `StorageService` that keeps a localStorage/in-memory model of users, applications, notifications, audit events and config, with seeded demo applications. It handles draft persistence and offline backup. Components often call both layers, so check which one a change belongs in.
- Shared types: `types.ts`. Business limits (loan amounts, repayment periods, fees, min age, visa validity): `config/appConfig.ts`.
- i18n: `i18n/translations.ts` with `en`, `he`, `th`, `zh` and a `t()` helper. Hebrew is RTL. New UI strings need entries in all four languages.
- The `@` import alias resolves to `frontend/` (not `src/`).
- The `.py` scripts in `frontend/` (`clean.py`, `fix_case.py`, `recover.py`) are one-off maintenance helpers, not part of the build. `scratch/` is gitignored.
